_Image: {"$title by $author. $optional-description" for artwork, "$description" for photos}_

November's top stories:

- new v1.6 RCs with tons of bugfixing and polishing
- dcrdex a stash of UI and backend improvements and some edge case fixes
- mobile apps and godcr formally funded via Pi
- more mainnet vspd deployments
- maybe: treasury activation on testnet { not sure its big enough for a highlight }
- maybe: new highs for ticket price and DCR locked

## v1.6 Release Candidate 4

New release candidates have a lot of bugs fixed in all four parts of the upcoming v1.6 release. Get the latest RC binaries [here](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases) (click `Assets`) and make sure to [verify them](https://docs.decred.org/advanced/verifying-binaries/).

Thanks everyone for helping to test the builds and move closer to the release of the epic v1.6.

## Development

Unless otherwise noted, the work reported here has the "merged to master" status. It means that the work is completed, reviewed, and integrated into the source code that advanced users can build and run, but is not yet available in release binaries for regular users.

**[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd)**

Decentralized treasury consensus rules have been [activated](https://twitter.com/degeri_crypto/status/1329980732110819331) on testnet without issues.

Merged in master (work towards v1.7) and backported to v1.6 release branch:

- limited mempool to not track stats for too many unconfirmed [ancestor](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2458) transactions. This prevents the possibility of a number of complexity attacks and speeds up block template generation for large chains of unconfirmed transactions.
- corrected treasury vote [status handling](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2469) in RPC commands
- added new fields to output of some RPC commands to indicate [treasurybase](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2470) and [treasuryspend](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2472) inputs (funds coming from the new treasury) and updated the docs
- fixed minor [sync issue](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2474) in the treasury code discovered on testnet
- default curve to generate RPC certificates changed to P-256 because Chromium (used by Decrediton) [removed](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/100991/why-is-secp521r1-no-longer-supported-in-chrome-others) support for a stronger P-521.

Other merged:

- gencerts tool gained the ability to generate certificates signed by a local CA certificate and key, which helps to reduce configuration complexity
- fixed concurrency issues
- more tests for [rpcserver](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/issues/2069)
- refactored database [upgrade](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2457) logic to deduplicate and make it faster to write future upgrades

**[dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet)**

- use [random coin](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1914) selection for all regular sends
- save unpublished [VSP fee](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1915) transaction to prevent double spends across wallet restarts
- send ticket's [parent](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1917) transaction along the VSP fee address request (to register the ticket faster, the VSP needs to be aware of the output funding the ticket, which typically comes from the "split transaction" mined in the same block and not always immediately visible by the VSP)
- use correct [change account](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1919) for paying VSP fees when performing a mixed ticket purchase, in order to prevent unmixed change from being used with a mixed account (there was no privacy leak because mixed VSP staking is not released yet and there was no such issue for mixed solo staking)
- make max VSP fee [configurable](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1933)
- bug fixes and documentation updates

**[Decrediton](https://github.com/decred/decrediton)**

- updating of Trezor [firmware](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2932) (a step towards [Trezor staking](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/issues/2681) support)
- [Privacy](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2987) page reworked for simplicity, following the updated [design](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/issues/2965)
- [help page](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2885) introducing Privacy features
- show [logs](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2888) on the Privacy page
- ability to allow sending transactions from accounts [other than](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2909) mixed account
- display filter for [mixed](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2926) transactions
- fixed wrong [change](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2889) destination for privacy wallets
- [filter](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2854) proposals that finished voting by their approved or rejected status
- don't allow to [close](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3005) Decrediton while certain operations are running
- [AppImage](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2864) packaging where Decrediton comes as a single executable file (as a side effect this allows GNOME users to avoid having to launch it via command line)
- removed [max wallets](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2886) limit
- updated [Chinese](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2927) translation
- added partial new [translations](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2974) to Arabic, Italian and Polish
- many UI tweaks

Around 60 bugs were fixed in October and ~65 in November. The growing list of Decrediton's features requires more testing firepower. Big thanks to all testers who help to improve Decrediton!

In progress:

- migration to [grpc-js](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2936) to significantly reduce build time and binary size
- automated tests for [Get Started](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2659) and [Settings](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2957) pages
- [Trezor](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2869) ticket purchasing on testnet

**[Politeia](https://github.com/decred/politeia)**

- [TOTP code](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1212) check on login (those 6-digit codes for 2FA)
- inline [images](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2201) in drafts
- numerous [design fixes](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2197)

- bug fixes

CMS:

- infrastructure for tracking GitHub [activity stats](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1185) which will be used to ensure that developers' progress matches their billed hours
- stats for past invoices and GitHub contributions on the Invoice page to help admins with the review
- multiple fixes

In progress:

- frontend support for [TOTP login](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2127)

**[vspd](https://github.com/decred/vspd)**

- do not reject tickets with [invalid](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/199) vote choices (this is desirable to not stall the registration of tickets when client or server are not up to date, explained [here](https://github.com/decred/vspd/issues/197#issuecomment-739478813))
- accept optional [parent transaction](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/205) in fee address request (see dcrwallet section above)
- bug fixes and code cleanup

**[dcrpool](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool)**

- completed [Postgres](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool/pull/282) implementation. All database tests are now run against both Bolt and Postgres. BoltDB only allows to deploy a single instance of dcrpool since it's an embedded key/value database. With Postgres, multiple dcrpool instances can be deployed against the same Postgres database.
- extracted [errors](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool/pull/284) package to support extracting database into its own package
- bug fixes and code cleanup

**[dcrlnd](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd)**

- added an [IPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-process_communication) [facility](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/pull/117) to allow parent processes (such as Decrediton) to control dcrlnd process

October's [porting](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/pull/103) of changes from the upstream lnd [0.11.1](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/releases/tag/v0.11.1-beta) included fixes of [two](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2020-October/002858.html) [vulnerabilities](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2020-October/002857.html) that may potentially lead to loss of funds. More background from the discoverer is [here](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2020-October/002859.html) and [here](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2020-October/002855.html).

It is recommended to upgrade to the latest master or release candidate [tag](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/tags) of dcrlnd.

## Governance

In November the [Treasury](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/address/Dcur2mcGjmENx4DhNqDctW5wJCVyT3Qeqkx) received 11,975 DCR and spent 13,846 DCR. Using November's daily average DCR/USD rate of $18.19, this is $218K received and $252K spent. At October's average daily rate of $12.01, the USD figure billed for past work is $166K. As of Dec 4, the Treasury balance is 636,385 DCR (16.4 million USD at $25.69).

There were 4 proposals published in October, 3 have been approved and 1 has been abandoned.

- GoDCR [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/e5c8051) from @raedah requested a budget of $60K to further develop (8 months) a Go-native desktop wallet using [Gio](https://gioui.org/) library. This proposal includes a $1,000/month sponsorship of Gio, for which GoDCR has become a pioneering project. Approved with 92% support and 38% turnout.
- A related mobile wallets [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/bc499c9) from @raedah requested $44K for a further 8 months of work on the Android and iOS wallets. Both mobile wallets and GoDCR share the [dcrlibwallet](https://github.com/planetdecred/dcrlibwallet) component, which allows all three to access new features added to it. Approved with 93% support and 38% turnout.
- A [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/3943bff) from @joegruff to further develop a Decred Address Scanner Android app requested $3,000 for work already completed (app has been open source and in the Google Play store for a year) and $6,000 maximum for necessary updates and new features. By popular demand in comments Joe [agreed](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/3943bff/comments/15) to add compact filters support to improve privacy, and even work voluntarily if needed (because it was too late to edit the proposal with this feature). The vote was tense as the support stayed [below](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/proposal/decred-address-scanner) 60% most of the time, but eventually the proposal was approved with 67% support and 34% turnout.
- A [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/8a09324) from @paris\_smithson to fund artwork production and marketing for [WhyDecred.com](https://www.whydecred.com/) originally requested $16,800 to fund 16 artworks, was edited to drop the request by $10K (to $6,800), before ultimately being abandoned with the idea that the site will be completed before another proposal is submitted.

Politeia Digest [issue 39](https://blockcommons.red/politeia-digest/issue039/) has more details on the month's proposals.

[decredcommunity/proposals](https://github.com/decredcommunity/proposals) repository has been reorganized for consistent structure. The repo currently holds 52 updates for 13 proposals. Please submit updates for your proposals as it helps to collect them in one place (vs searching across chats and Reddit) and protect from loss. _(summon @bee if you don't want to face GitHub alone)_

## Network

Hashrate: November's [hashrate](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=hashrate&zoom=kgw9asu9-ki79jtll&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time) opened at ~226 Ph/s and closed ~293 Ph/s, bottoming at 215 Ph/s and peaking at 566 Ph/s throughout the month.

## Integrations

Welcome the new [vsp.decredcommunity.org](https://vsp.decredcommunity.org/) service that is running a mainnet instance of the new vspd software. As of writing it has ~70 live and ~30 voted tickets.

Existing providers [decredbrasil.com](https://vspd.decredbrasil.com/), [99split.com](https://vspd.99split.com/), and [stakeminer.com](https://vsp.stakeminer.com/) have all launched vspd instances in addition to their existing dcrstakepool servers listed at [decred.org/vsp](https://decred.org/vsp/).

As of writing we have a total of 5 mainnet vspd services to choose from. Thank you all for supporting [a more private](https://blog.decred.org/2020/06/02/A-More-Private-Way-to-Stake/) way to stake.

[Stakey.net](https://stakey.net/) VSP is now posting status and support updates on [Mastodon](https://citadel.stakey.net/@support).

## Outreach

To address the longstanding challenge of [spreading content and news](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/jz0bq1/decred_skepticism_sunday_22_november_2020/gd9auhx/), @Exitus and others have assembled a Marketing Workgroup in Telegram to help coordinate:

> Thus far, it has proven to be a productive and a positive force. If anyone would like to participate and add value, please DM me.

Mastodon server launched by Stakey.net VSP for their [support](https://citadel.stakey.net/@support) account is open to the Decred community via this [invite link](https://citadel.stakey.net/invite/tZ2Cm5FX). [Mastodon](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/) is an open-source, self-hosted microblogging alternative to Twitter and is part of the [Fediverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse).

Decred is now listed as a sponsor at [gioui.org](https://gioui.org/).

Decred in Spanish published 5th monthly [report](https://github.com/decredcommunity/proposals/blob/master/proposals/3c02b67/updates/20201120.md) of activities and expenses for their second proposal that is ending in December. A big final [report](https://github.com/DecredES/Monthly_reports/blob/master/Final_Report_June_December_2020.md) covering June-December was published together with the [3rd proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/350f64b) to continue the effort.

Blockchain Learning Challenge (co-organized by Decred in Spanish and Talent Land Network) had 6 projects that made it to the finals. Participants published source code on GitHub and presented their projects in short video pitches. 5 judges have rated each project in 5 areas (how much data was used and how, how original and relevant for Decred the idea is, how easy it is to use the app, how finished the app is, and how well things are documented). Summary of the finals with all ratings and links is [here](https://github.com/DecredES/Challenge/blob/main/Proyectos-Finalistas.md), and the final award video is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQTitBVUMMY).

@michae2xl published a [report](https://github.com/decredcommunity/proposals/blob/master/proposals/bc20f98/updates/20201203.md) of his November activities for the Brazil Marketing proposal.

## Markets

In November DCR was trading between USD 11.71-24.78 / BTC 0.00086-0.00135. The average daily rate was $18.19.

The TIE has [demonstrated](https://twitter.com/TheTIEIO/status/1334586246606319623) a correlation between the climbing DCR/USD and 30-day average tweet volume.

An odd panic spike down to BTC 0.00075 was [observed](https://twitter.com/Mr_DEX89/status/1326602830053068802) on Binance.

On Nov 12 @jy-p [informed](https://matrix.to/#/!mlRZqBtfWHrcmgdTWB:decred.org/$ZPdL5sG-IwT034pc7FldzbijUOjAe3u0ja1OkcabU_g) that the DEX had traded 191K DCR in total. This averages to 10 BTC/day.

## Relevant External

The replacement for P2SH in BSV's Electrum wallet was [found](https://www.reddit.com/r/bsv/comments/jq9jv3/and_its_gone_popular_bsv_multisig_provides_no/) to be fundamentally broken, allowing anyone to spend coins held in multi-sig hashes on the BSV chain.

The Value DeFi protocol was [hacked](https://rekt.ghost.io/value-defi-rekt/) for $7M, although the attacker returned $2M to the contract address for unknown reasons. The exploit was executed with a flash loan, coming less than 24 hours after Value DeFi had tweeted (now deleted) to boast about robust security with "flash loan attack prevention". 

The OUSD stablecoin was [hacked](https://medium.com/originprotocol/urgent-ousd-has-hacked-and-there-has-been-a-loss-of-funds-7b8c4a7d534c) with a flash loan used to conduct a reentrancy attack, to print and rebase (debase) OUSD equivalent to almost the entire circulating supply, allowing the hacker to extract $7M in value. 

A flash loan was also used to [exploit](https://decrypt.co/46575/group-uses-flash-loan-to-game-maker-protocol-governance) MakerDAO's governance system, by borrowing $7M worth of MKR tokens and using these to vote before immediately repaying the loan. MakerDAO's [response](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/urgent-flash-loans-and-securing-the-maker-protocol/4901) has been to disable certain executive functions in case an attacker is able to access them, and extend the cooling off period during which the community can respond to unexpected proposals passing. Such a weakness would not be exposed if MKR holders were required to lock tokens for some time in order to vote - or if the amount of MKR available to borrow was less than the amount legitimately engaged in the governance system.

The soft-fork implementation of Schnorr signatures and Taproot was [merged](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19953) to Bitcoin Core in October, but as yet there is no agreement on the method for [activating](https://www.coindesk.com/taproot-ready-bitcoin-developers-debate-activation) the change on the network. There is also an unpopular [argument](https://twitter.com/nikzh/status/1332246112196063232) that Taproot will make Bitcoin's privacy situation even worse for regular users by introducing a yet another address scheme. Taproot will add a new type of Schnorr signature, which will allow for greater flexibility with multi-signature wallets and for these transactions to look the same as regular transactions.

The Ethereum 2.0 beacon chain deposit contract was [released](https://www.coindesk.com/ethereum-2-0-contract-deposit-mainnet) in early Nov and reached the target 540,000 ETH deposited on Nov 24, with the final 150,000 ETH coming just hours before a deadline set for a Dec 1 launch. The beacon chain is the first of 4 phases to the launch and migration to Ethereum 2.0, in this initial form the chain's only purpose is to ensure PoS validators can remain in consensus. 

The latest Bitcoin Cash hard fork [occurred](https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-cash-has-split-into-two-new-blockchains-again) in November, this time the focus of dispute is funding for the ABC developers. This hash war had a clear [winner](https://abc.coin.dance/blocks/hashrate), with the BCHN chain (no dev funding) attracting virtually all of the mining power. Ahead of the fork, over 1 million BCH was [observed](https://twitter.com/philip_gradwell/status/1326452365004861440) moving to exchanges (selling a risky asset and receiving split coins are two common reasons for doing so).

Ethereum network experienced a [disruption](https://www.coindesk.com/ethereums-hard-fork-disruption) on Nov 11. A recent version of Geth node software silently fixed a consensus bug that was dormant for over a year. Since it changed consensus code, it had a risk of an unintended hard fork. One vendor discovered the bug independently and seeing that the majority of nodes have upgraded, decided to test it [in production](https://twitter.com/jinglanW/status/1326651349912719360) and see what would happen. To everyone's surprise, among the minority of nodes running old software was Infura, a popular service provider used by "dapps" to sync with Ethereum network. The bug-triggering transaction halted Infura and a bunch of "decentralized" finance apps that relied on it, including Metamask, MakerDAO, Uniswap, Compound, and others. Binance and other exchanges have also halted trading after noticing conflicting transaction histories. Infura resolved the issue within hours and posted a [post-mortem](https://blog.infura.io/infura-mainnet-outage-post-mortem-2020-11-11/) explaining why they didn't upgrade and calling out the danger of silent consensus fixes. Ethereum developer also published a [post-mortem](https://gist.github.com/karalabe/e1891c8a99fdc16c4e60d9713c35401f) for Geth, which explained that the fix was done silently to not attract unwanted attention from attackers. Among other things, the incident teaches us that deploying critical fixes is challenging because it is a trade-off between informing good actors while not informing bad ones.

The Aragon project is in the [process](https://aragon.org/blog/lightweight-process) of decommissioning the ANJ token which was introduced one year ago as the token to use with "Aragon Court", a dispute resolution service for Aragon DAOs. The ANJ token is now seen as a barrier to the success of Aragon Court, and will be bought out by the ANT holders by issuing ~1-5% inflation to the holders of ANJ.

US authorities [seized](https://www.coindesk.com/u-s-seized-more-than-1b-in-silk-road-linked-bitcoin-seeks-forfeiture-bloomberg) 69,370 BTC (and forks) worth around $1 billion, apparently with the consent of an unnamed hacker who had stolen the funds from Silk Road in 2013.
