<a id="dcrd" />

**[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd)**

The way standard scripts are handled has been reworked to address a number of long-standing issues.

For a quick background, "[scripts](https://devdocs.decred.org/developer-guides/transactions/txscript/overview/)" are small commands stored inside [transactions](https://devdocs.decred.org/developer-guides/transactions/transaction-format/) that consume "input" coins from past transactions and create new "output" coins with new conditions how they can be spent, which to us humans looks like "sending funds". "Standard scripts" is a subset of all scripts allowed by the consensus that covers most useful operations (sending, staking, multisig, etc) optimized for efficiency and network security. Mainnet nodes will normally [refuse](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2656#issuecomment-851105968) to accept and relay transactions containing non-standard scripts.

The [reworked code](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2656) adds a new package called `stdscript` that supports different script versions (this was hard to support previously and is required for the next consensus upgrade), provides a more ergonomic API for developers (including multisig and atomic swap helpers) and improves separation between "standard" and "consensus" (a common point of confusion for new developers). Additionally, the policy of what scripts are considered "standard" has been further tightened to help ensure the typical scripts occupy less space on chain and further restrict cases that don't make sense.

As usual, this large change comes in a series of easy-to-digest commits with informative descriptions, tests, benchmarks, examples, all finished with a thorough new [README](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/blob/master/internal/staging/stdscript/README.md).

{ I couldn't resist writing it up, but have a second look if it's too much for stdscript }

A number of other [changes](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pulls?q=standardness+is%3Apr+merged%3A2021-06-01..2021-06-30+sort%3Aupdated-asc) have been focused on removing the usages of standardness code from consensus code since the latter must not change in case the policy of what is considered "standard" changes.

A [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/record/3a98861) for developing the next consensus change has been submitted and approved. This upgrade will practically forbid soft forks to simplify future consensus changes and [improve security](https://proposals.decred.org/record/3a98861/comments/8). Once it activates, full nodes will start rejecting transactions and scripts of newer versions they do not understand, instead of ignoring them and believing they still fully validate the chain.

> Soft forks are primarily the outgrowth of less capable systems with technical shortcomings and the lack of formal governance processes necessary to uncontroversially deploy them ([@davecgh](https://proposals.decred.org/record/3a98861))

Further departure from soft forks is possible thanks to Decred's drama-free process of coordinating hard forks and its highly engaged community.

<a id="dcrwallet" />

**[dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet)**

- an option to randomly [disapprove](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2054) blocks, intended for testing and cannot be used on mainnet
- updated to latest [dcrd modules](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2056), including the new `stdaddr`
- removed attempts to vote or revoke when private key is [not available](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/2062) (should prevent some ticketbuyer errors)
- use multiple [connections](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1983) when auto-buying tickets (may result in slower mixing if the funding account has limited UTXOs)

<a id="decrediton" />

**[Decrediton](https://github.com/decred/decrediton)**

- gray out the [DEX tab](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3505) instead of hiding it in SPV mode and show a tooltip (a lot of people have been confused by this)
- added [advanced](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3487) options for restoring wallet (disable coin type upgrades and setting the gap limit)
- allow [empty passphrases](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3470) with Trezor [passphrase](https://wiki.trezor.io/Passphrase) feature
- support for entering passphrase on the [Trezor](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3496) itself instead of asking it in Decrediton (works for Model T)
- implemented new UI design for [Governance](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3467) views (both Proposals and Consensus Changes)
- [integrated](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3398) input component from the pi-ui library. To support Decrediton's design it was [updated](https://github.com/decred/pi-ui/pull/326) with new features that Decred's other React-based projects can now also use.
- automated tests for [Send](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3489), [Receive](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3490), and [Export](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3493) views
- reorganized, cleaned up and optimized [Webpack config](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3503)
- disabled [Node integration](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3486) in the UI code so that UI code can no longer access the low level Node and Electron APIs directly. This is an important security feature and a recommended practice in modern Electron app development.
- [context isolation](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3492) enabled in main window - another important security feature further restricting the UI code { maybe note that it was a long road }
- enabled the [webSecurity](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3500) feature to tighten up external requests (this has also fixed the development mode on Windows)
- reduced [dependencies](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3509) to rely less on third party code and improve security by reducing the attack surface of a possibly supply chain attack
- introduced a more secure confirmation dialog and used it for confirming [VSP access](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3515) and [transaction signing](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3519)
- ~10 bug fixes

- `politeiavoter` will now [retry](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1438) its votes on server errors
- added [MySQL](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1419) implementation for the user database (the backend uses MySQL because of [tlog](https://github.com/decred/politeia/issues/1392))
  - { can also comment why we need to migrate from cockroach to mysql }
- updated [READMEs](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1421) with setup instructions to get a full Politeia instance up and running (new contributors, wait no more!)

- compare [scripts](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/267) rather than addresses when verifying fee payments (this is more correct, more efficient and fixes one edge case)
- [filtering](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/265) of database tickets made more than twice faster
- ensure ticket [purchase height](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/277) is set for all tickets
- improved [shutdown](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/271) handling
- refactored [GUI cache](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/273) for better reuse
- [UI tweaks](https://github.com/decred/vspd/pull/274)

## Governance

In June the new [Treasury](https://dcrdata.decred.org/treasury) received 10,510 DCR worth $1.4 million at June's average rate of $131.52. 1,460 DCR was spent (from the legacy Treasury address) to pay contractors, worth $192,000 at June's rate, or $253,000 at May's billing rate of $173.47. As of Jul 2, combined balance of [legacy](https://dcrdata.decred.org/address/Dcur2mcGjmENx4DhNqDctW5wJCVyT3Qeqkx) and new Treasury is 692,988 DCR (91.4 million USD at $131.88).

Three proposals were published on Politeia, and all three have been approved with strong approval ratings.

- The [Explicit Version Upgrades Consensus Change](https://proposals.decred.org/record/3a98861) proposal hit a new approval milestone with 99.9% Yes votes and just 13 tickets voting against the proposal among the 47% turnout.
- The fourth iteration of the Bounty [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/record/e1f104b) returned with a boosted payout schedule and was approved with 98.5% Yes votes and turnout of 47%.
- The second phase of the big translation [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/record/af9942a) was approved with 97.3% approval and turnout of 46%.

## Network

{ section hint: use the same `zoom` parameter for all dcrdata links }

**Hashrate**: June's [hashrate](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=hashrate&zoom=kpb32srm-kqn8vbkn&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time) opened at ~369 Ph/s and closed ~73 Ph/s, bottoming at 61.4 Ph/s and peaking at 438 Ph/s throughout the month.

Distribution of hashrate [reported](https://miningpoolstats.stream/decred) by the pools on July 1: Poolin 37%, F2Pool 27.8%, Antpool 8.5%, Luxor 5.3%, BTC.com 5.12%,  Huobipool 1%, UUPool 0.19%, Coinmine 0.11%.

As you can see above had a large drop in hashrate due to miners shifting out of China due to a recent [ban](https://www.coindesk.com/chinas-bitcoin-mining-crackdown-is-a-boon-for-miners-elsewhere). This is especially visible in ASIC mined coins like Decred and [Bitcoin](https://twitter.com/krugermacro/status/1409484360651317250). 

{ hint: fallback link for pool distribution: https://dcrstats.com/pow }

Distribution of 1,000 blocks actually [mined](https://miningpoolstats.stream/decred) before {date}: {PoolName n%, ...}.

**Staking**: [Ticket price](https://explorer.decred.org/charts?chart=ticket-price&zoom=kpb32srm-kqn8vbkn&bin=window&axis=time&visibility=true-true) varied between 168.1-208.14 DCR, with 30-day [average](https://dcrstats.com/) at 184.72 DCR (-1.02).

The [locked amount](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=ticket-pool-value&zoom=kpb32srm-kqn8vbkn&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time
) was 7.33-7.72 million DCR, meaning that 56.1-59% of the circulating supply [participated](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=stake-participation&zoom=kpb32srm-kqn8vbkn&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time) in proof-of-stake.

**VSP**: On {}, {} (+{}) live tickets were managed by vspd servers and {} (-{}) by the [listed](https://decred.org/vsp/) legacy dcrstakepool servers. Collectively the {} legacy and {} new VSPs managed {}% of the ticket pool. {How to do this ?}

**Nodes**: Throughout June there were around 216.23 reachable nodes according to [dcrextdata](https://analytics.planetdecred.org/nodes).

Daily [mixed amount](https://dcrdata.decred.org/charts?chart=privacy-participation&zoom={t1}-{t2}&bin=day&axis=time) varied between {n}-{n}K DCR.

{ maybe } Decred's [Lightning Network](https://ln-map.jholdstock.uk/) has seen {} nodes (+{}), {} channels (+{}) with a total capacity of {n.n} DCR (+{n.n}), as of {date}.

A large scale migration of Bitcoin (and others) hashrate from China is underway, and it's being covered in all the [mainstream](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/15/chinas-bitcoin-miner-exodus-.html) [business](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-20/bitcoin-drops-as-hashrate-declines-with-china-mining-crackdown) [publications](https://www.forbes.com/sites/zinnialee/2021/06/23/bitcoin-mining-companies-exiting-china-as-authorities-crackdown-on-cryptocurrencies/).  The exodus was triggered after Chinese authorities made statements about cracking down on Bitcoin mining, and then several provinces made it clear to miners that they had to stop. One of the issues the mining companies face in [relocating](https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-unpacking-hashrate-nic-cart-migration) their hashing hardware is with the current [high](https://compassmining.io/education/cost-bitcoin-miners-leaving-china/) price of international shipping.

The Zcash Open Major Grants program has [funded](https://www.coindesk.com/tor-project-zcash-open-major-grants-zomg-arti-coding-language-upgrade) the Tor Project with $670,000, to be used for paying developer salaries as they work towards Arti (A rust tor implementation) - which would make Tor more accessible to other applications, including Zcash.

The Uniswap community is [considering](https://thedefiant.io/uniswap-lobby/) funding a "DeFi political defense fund" with $27M to $40M USD, the fund's purpose would be to "educate policymakers, achieve regulatory clarity for DeFi, support DeFi  and decentralized governance, and encourage other DeFi protocols to  contribute ideas and support". As it progressed through a [temperature check](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/temperature-check-funding-a-political-defense-of-defi/12557) and [consensus check](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/consensus-check-uni-should-fund-a-political-defense-organization-for-decentralized-finance-copy/12717) phase, it became the more general "DeFi Education Fund" by the time it came to a [vote](https://app.uniswap.org/#/vote/0/1) (which concluded at the end of June with 84% approval.

The Curve DeFi project is [considering](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/108561/the-first-dao-lawsuit-proposal-asks-if-curve-should-protect-its-ip) whether to enforce its intellectual property rights in court. A [proposal](https://gov.curve.fi/t/cip-xx-enforce-curves-ip-rights/1890/3) is under discussion which would see the Curve DAO members soliciting and approving or rejecting proposals from law firms, related to shutting down competitor projects that have copied Curve's code (which includes the stipulation that â€œno license, right of reproduction or distribution or other right with respect thereto is granted or implied").

There has been a run on the Iron Titanium protocol, which saw it [incentivize](https://www.coindesk.com/iron-finance-defi-titan-iron-price-drop) its own rapid and irrevocable decline to zero once certain rare trading conditions were met.

The ironically titled "SafeDollar" also went to zero this month after being [hacked](https://securityboulevard.com/2021/06/safedollar-stablecoin-not-safe-nor-stable-hack-sends-value-to-zero/), with the attacker looting around $248,000 worth of tokens.

THORChain, which some Decred community members have been engaging with around a DCR integration, [suffered](https://twitter.com/THORChain/status/1409630489611182081) its first malicious attack. A [postmortem](https://twitter.com/THORChain/status/1409736048960180227) indicated $140K was taken by exploiting a logic error in the ETH Bifrost. The network was halted for 6 hours while a fix was deployed. THORChain said it will cover losses incurred by users from treasury funds.
