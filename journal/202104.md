## Development

The work reported below has the "merged to master" status unless noted otherwise. It means that the work is completed, reviewed, and integrated into the source code that advanced users can [build and run](https://medium.com/@artikozel/the-decred-node-back-to-the-source-part-one-27d4576e7e1c), but is not yet available in release binaries for regular users.

<a id="dcrd" />

**[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd)**

- codebase [converted](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2625) to use the new `stdaddr` package for handling addresses. As common for large changes, to make review easier this one was split into a series of individual commits such that everything builds and passes all tests each step of the way. { "make use of the script version" - how is this different from not making use of it previously? }
- introduced [UTXO database](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2632) that will allow to optimize reading and writing of the UTXO set, and also decouple it from the other databases. { my text is blurry on why this is exciting (esp. the decoupling), better wording is welcome }
- added [median time](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2638) over the last 11 blocks to verbose `getblock` and `getblockheader` results (used by DCRDEX)
- allow to specify interfaces to listen by [names](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2623) in addition to exact IP addresses

<a id="dcrwallet" />

**[dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet)**

- a new method that returns wallet's [sync status](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1991)
- handle ticket status when the VSP has [received](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1965) its fee tx but has not yet broadcast it
- fixed bugs found when used by DCRDEX

<a id="decrediton" />

**[Decrediton](https://github.com/decred/decrediton)**

- initial [DEX integration](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3356) { how does it work, i.e. does it run a one more daemon? is there a BTC wallet? UI shots? }
- a form for [funding](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3426) the DEX account from the registration view
- allow to use an [existing](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3438) wallet account for the DEX instead of making a new one
- added [QR code](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3112) generation to export active tickets (to be used with the Decred Address Scanner app)
- [remember](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3441) ticket auto-buyer settings
- added a migration to initialize [account](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2664) passphrases with the wallet passphrase. Also, some operations (send, purchase ticket, mixing, revoke) switched to only unlock a single needed account instead of unlocking an entire wallet.
- lock [new accounts](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3424) after creation
- allow restoring hex seeds up to 128 characters (including BIP0039 seeds)
- updated design of [Transactions](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3326), [Proposals](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3345) and [Purchase tickets](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3349) views
- many smaller design tweaks
- switched to a strict Protobuf generation without `eval()` and restricted to only access exteral servers via `https` in production builds using the [CSP header](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3366)
- refactoring of state management, separation of concerns, dependency upgrades
- expanded test coverage
- ~24 bug fixes

Release [v1.6.3](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/tree/release-v1.6%2B) is being prepared.

<a id="politeia" />

**[Politeia](https://github.com/decred/politeia)**

- add Unix [timestamp](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1395) to cast votes { is there no temporal batching due to tstore now? does it lower privacy? }
- list registration fee in the [history](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2322) of purchases
- ~24 bugs discovered in the new version have been fixed

{ section hint: use the same `zoom` parameter for all dcrdata links }

**Hashrate**: April's [hashrate](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=hashrate&zoom=kmvlwq6x-ko7rp8zy&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time) opened at ~464 Ph/s and closed ~429 Ph/s, bottoming at 219 Ph/s and peaking at 587 Ph/s throughout the month.

Distribution of hashrate [reported](https://miningpoolstats.stream/decred) by the pools on May 1: Poolin 34.75%, Antpool 27.67%, F2Pool 17.81%, Easy2mine 3.89%, BTC.com 1.76%, Luxor 1.31%, UUPool 0.086%, Coinmine 0.063%, Huobipool 0.024%, Other 12.6%.

**Staking**: [Ticket price](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=ticket-price&zoom=kmv7w940-ko7df59q&scale=linear&bin=window&axis=time&visibility=true-false) varied between 163.49-204.1 DCR, with 30-day [average](https://dcrstats.com/) at 185.83 DCR (+7.83).

The [locked amount](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=ticket-pool-value&zoom=kmvltoqc-ko7rp3w3&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time&visibility=true-false) was 7.1-7.5 million DCR, meaning that 55.4-58.4% of the circulating supply [participated](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=stake-participation&zoom=kmvmb2ag-ko7s6soq&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time&visibility=true-false) in proof-of-stake.
