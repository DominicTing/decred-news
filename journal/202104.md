## Development

The work reported below has the "merged to master" status unless noted otherwise. It means that the work is completed, reviewed, and integrated into the source code that advanced users can [build and run](https://medium.com/@artikozel/the-decred-node-back-to-the-source-part-one-27d4576e7e1c), but is not yet available in release binaries for regular users.

<a id="dcrd" />

**[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd)**

- codebase [converted](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2625) to use the new `stdaddr` package. Code that deals with addresses now supports different script versions and is one step closer to being able to cleanly introduce new scripting language versions. As common for large changes, to make review easier this one was split into a series of individual commits such that everything builds and passes all tests each step of the way.
- introduced [UTXO database](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2632). It paves the way for a specialized UTXO database implementation that can be made more efficient in terms of both processing time and memory usage.
- added [median time](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2638) over the last 11 blocks to verbose `getblock` and `getblockheader` results (used by DCRDEX)
- allow to specify interfaces to listen by [names](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2623) in addition to exact IP addresses

<a id="dcrwallet" />

**[dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet)**

- a new method that returns wallet's [sync status](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1991)
- handle ticket status when the VSP has [received](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1965) its fee tx but has not yet broadcast it
- fixed bugs found when used by DCRDEX

<a id="decrediton" />

**[Decrediton](https://github.com/decred/decrediton)**

- initial [DEX integration](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3356) { how does it work, i.e. does it run a one more daemon? is there a BTC wallet? UI shots? }
- a form for [funding](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3426) the DEX account from the registration view
- allow to use an [existing](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3438) wallet account for the DEX instead of making a new one
- added [QR code](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3112) generation to export active tickets (to be used with the Decred Address Scanner app)
- [remember](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3441) ticket auto-buyer settings
- added a migration to initialize [account](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2664) passphrases with the wallet passphrase. Also, some operations (send, purchase ticket, mixing, revoke) switched to only unlock a single needed account instead of unlocking an entire wallet.
- lock [new accounts](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3424) after creation
- allow restoring hex seeds up to 128 characters (including BIP0039 seeds)
- updated design of [Transactions](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3326), [Proposals](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3345) and [Purchase tickets](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3349) views
- many smaller design tweaks
- switched to a strict Protobuf generation without `eval()` and restricted to only access external servers via `https` in production builds using the [CSP header](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3366)
- refactoring of state management, separation of concerns, dependency upgrades
- expanded test coverage
- ~24 bug fixes

Release [v1.6.3](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/tree/release-v1.6%2B) is being prepared.

<a id="politeia" />

**[Politeia](https://github.com/decred/politeia)**

- list [proposals](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2340) from [proposals-archive.decred.org](https://proposals-archive.decred.org/) on the new version
- [verify](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1377) comment and vote bundles in the `politeiaverify` tool
- list registration fee in the [history](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2322) of purchases
- ~24 bugs discovered in the new version have been fixed

One notable change is the addition of [timestamps](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1395) to cast votes. In Git backend precise timestamps were not stored to improve voter privacy and it was only possible to determine if a vote was cast within a ~60 min period. In tstore backend timestamp is already being recorded by Trillian and this cannot be disabled without writing a custom Trillian implementation. Because vote timestamp is now public data anyway, adding it directly to the vote structure allows dcrdata to obtain it much easier (to build its vote [graphs](https://dcrdata.decred.org/proposal/video-content-production-for-decred-phase-3)). But it also means a bit lower privacy for people casting all their votes at once. People who want to protect their privacy are strongly advised to use `politeiavoter`'s [trickling feature](https://github.com/decred/politeia/blob/master/politeiawww/cmd/politeiavoter/README.md#privacy-considerations).

Politeia v1.0.0 has been released including the new tstore backend, v2 API, new plugin architecture and 5 plugins. Read the [release notes](https://github.com/decred/politeia/releases/tag/v1.0.0) for full details on each feature. The new version has been deployed at [proposals.decred.org](https://proposals.decred.org/).

## Governance

In April the [Treasury](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/address/Dcur2mcGjmENx4DhNqDctW5wJCVyT3Qeqkx) received 10,949 DCR and spent 984 DCR. Using April's daily average DCR/USD rate of $198.60, this is $2.17M received and $195K spent. At March's average daily rate of $161.01, the USD figure billed for past work is $158K. As of May 2, Treasury balance is 672,768 DCR (140 million USD at $208.13).

- A new [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/record/91cfcc8) for funding Politeia development accompanied the deployment of v1.0.0. This proposal requests a maximum budget of $118K to cover a range of new features, expected to be delivered over a six month period. The features on this roadmap include another upgrade to the plugin architecture, user API overhaul, email-free accounts, extra metadata for proposals, proposal life cycles, and proposal author updates.
- The video production phase 3 [proposal](https://proposals-archive.decred.org/proposals/95a1409) was approved with 98% approval and voter participation of 40%.
- The Design domain [proposal](https://proposals-archive.decred.org/proposals/76eba5a) for remainder of 2021 was approved with 97% approval and voter participation of 28%.

Politeia Digest [issue 42](https://blockcommons.red/politeia-digest/issue042/) has more details on the month's proposals.

## Network

{ section hint: use the same `zoom` parameter for all dcrdata links }

**Hashrate**: April's [hashrate](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=hashrate&zoom=kmvlwq6x-ko7rp8zy&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time) opened at ~464 Ph/s and closed ~429 Ph/s, bottoming at 219 Ph/s and peaking at 587 Ph/s throughout the month.

Distribution of hashrate [reported](https://miningpoolstats.stream/decred) by the pools on May 1: Poolin 35%, Antpool 28%, F2Pool 18%, Easy2Mine 4%, BTC.com 1.8%, Luxor 1.3%, UUPool 0.09%, Coinmine 0.06%, Huobipool 0.02%, other 12%.

{ hint: fallback link for pool distribution: https://dcrstats.com/pow }

Distribution of 1,000 blocks actually [mined](https://miningpoolstats.stream/decred) before May 1: Poolin 37%, Antpool 28%\*, F2Pool 19%, BTC.com 1.7%, Luxor 1.6%, Easy2Mine 1.3%, UUPool 0.2%, Coinmine 0.1%, unknown 11%. \*Antpool's address was not identified by our [data source](https://miningpoolstats.stream/decred) but it is assumed based on exact match with pool's reported hashrate.

A sharp hashrate drop around Apr 15-20 may have been due to a major [power outage](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/mvk976/network_hashrate_plummeting/) in China.

**Staking**: [Ticket price](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=ticket-price&zoom=kmvlwq6x-ko7rp8zy&axis=time&visibility=true-false&mode=stepped) varied between 163.5-204.1 DCR, with 30-day [average](https://dcrstats.com/) at 185.8 DCR (+7.8).

The [locked amount](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=ticket-pool-value&zoom=kmvlwq6x-ko7rp8zy&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time) was 7.11-7.51 million DCR, meaning that 55.4-58.5% of the circulating supply [participated](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=stake-participation&zoom=kmvlwq6x-ko7rp8zy&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time) in proof-of-stake.

{ recap of ticket price action if it was interesting }

**Nodes**: Throughout April there were around ~210 reachable nodes according to [dcrextdata](https://dcrextdata.planetdecred.org/nodes).

Node versions as of May 1 [snapshot](https://nodes.jholdstock.uk/user_agents) (257 total, dcrd only): v1.6.0 - 26%, v1.6.2 - 24%, v1.6.1 - 22%, v1.5.2 - 7%,, v1.5.1 - 7%, v1.7 dev builds - 7%, v1.6 dev builds - 4%, v1.5.0 - 2%.

The share of [mixed coins](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=coin-supply&zoom=kmvlwq6x-ko7rp8zy&bin=day&axis=time&visibility=true-true-true) has slightly declined from 44% to 42%. Daily [mixed amount](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=privacy-participation&zoom=kguk0rxu-koc4hs00&bin=day&axis=time) varied between 150-300K DCR.

{ maybe } Decred's [Lightning Network](https://ln-map.jholdstock.uk/) has seen {} nodes (+{}), {} channels (+{}) with a total capacity of {n.n} DCR (+{n.n}), as of {date}.

The Yearn Finance community have been discussing [YIP-61](https://gov.yearn.finance/t/yip-61-governance-2-0/10460/25) "Governance 2.0", which extends the multisig arrangement put in place temporarily by YIP-41, and [approving](https://snapshot.org/#/ybaby.eth/proposal/QmSMyYeKrRpnA7Xn56o2NtbCUzxmhzCupL7LxMA1reXxq4) it with 99.97% yes votes. This proposal also delegates certain powers to a set of yearn contributor teams ("yTeams"), and "clarifies" the role of YFI holders as being primarily about delegating powers to these teams and approving YIPs.

The NFT sub-community is crowdfunding its own new media platform ([NFTs WTF](https://nfts.wtf)), via the mechanism of selling 100 NFTs that confer voting rights in a DAO that will support the platform. It is interesting to note that the [post](https://nfts.wtf/crowdfunding-the-worlds-first-d-zine/) announcing the first phase of the crowdsale, in which 51 of the 100 controlling tokens were sold, only 3 were sold to Venture Capitalists, and as individuals not representatives of their organizations.
