## Development

The work reported below has the "merged to master" status unless noted otherwise. It means that the work is completed, reviewed, and integrated into the source code that advanced users can [build and run](https://medium.com/@artikozel/the-decred-node-back-to-the-source-part-one-27d4576e7e1c), but is not yet available in release binaries for regular users.

{ hint: add below overview of activity for each project. add any other project that warrants a paragraph, drop projects without notable updates. for each project the order of reporting is: changes released > merged to master > started work > discussions and future plans }

<a id="dcrd" />

**[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd)**

- codebase [converted](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2625) to use the new `stdaddr` package for handling addresses. As common for large changes, to make review easier this one was split into a series of individual commits such that everything builds and passes all tests each step of the way. { "make use of the script version" - how is this different from not making use of it before the conversion? }
- introduced [UTXO database](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2632) that will allow to optimize reading and writing of the UTXO set, and also decouple it from the other databases. { my text is a bit blurry on why this is exciting (esp. the decoupling), better wording is welcome }
- added [median time](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2638) over the last 11 blocks to verbose `getblock` and `getblockheader` results (used by DCRDEX)
- allow to specify interfaces to listen by [names](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2623) in addition to exact IP addresses

<a id="dcrwallet" />

**[dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet)**

- a new method that returns wallet's [sync status](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1991)
- handle ticket status when the VSP has [received](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1965) its fee tx but has not yet broadcast it
- fixed bugs found when used by DCRDEX

<a id="decrediton" />

**[Decrediton](https://github.com/decred/decrediton)**

- initial [DEX integration](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3356) { how does it work, i.e. does it run a one more daemon? is there a BTC wallet? UI shots? }
- a form for [funding](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3426) the DEX account from the registration view
- allow to use an [existing](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3438) wallet account for the DEX
- added [QR code](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3112) generation to export active tickets (to be used with the Decred Address Scanner app)
- [remember](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3441) ticket auto-buyer settings
- added a migration to initialize [account](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2664) passphrases with the wallet passphrase. Also, some operations (send, purchase ticket, mixing, revoke) switched to only unlock a single needed account instead of unlocking an entire wallet.
- lock [new accounts](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3424) after creation
- allow restoring hex seeds up to 128 characters (including BIP0039 seeds)
- polished layout of [Transactions](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3326) views
- updated design of [Proposals](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3345) and [Purchase tickets](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3349) views
- many smaller design tweaks

- switched to a strict Protobuf generation without `eval()` and restricted to only access exteral servers via `https` in production builds using the [CSP header](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/3366)
- refactoring of state management, separation of concerns, dependency upgrades
- expanded test coverage
- ~24 bug fixes

Release [v1.6.3](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/tree/release-v1.6%2B) is being prepared.

## Network

{ section hint: use the same `zoom` parameter for all dcrdata links }

**Hashrate**: April's [hashrate](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=hashrate&zoom={t1}-{t2}&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time) {set zoom to show the month} opened at ~{n} Ph/s and closed ~{n} Ph/s, bottoming at {n} Ph/s and peaking at {n} Ph/s throughout the month.

Distribution of hashrate [reported](https://miningpoolstats.stream/decred) by the pools on {date}: {PoolName n%, ...}.

{ hint: fallback link for pool distribution: https://dcrstats.com/pow }

Distribution of 1,000 blocks actually [mined](https://miningpoolstats.stream/decred) before {date}: {PoolName n%, ...}.

https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/mvk976/network_hashrate_plummeting/

**Staking**: [Ticket price](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=ticket-price&zoom={t1}-{t2}&axis=time&visibility=true-true&mode=stepped) varied between {n.n}-{n.n} DCR, with 30-day [average](https://dcrstats.com/) at {n.n} DCR (+{n.n}). { use same t1-t2 for zoom }

The [locked amount](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=ticket-pool-value&zoom={t1}-{t2}&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time) was {n.nn}-{n.nn} million DCR, meaning that {n.n}-{n.n}% of the circulating supply [participated](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=stake-participation&zoom={t1}-{t2}&scale=linear&bin=block&axis=time) in proof-of-stake.

{ recap of ticket price action if it was interesting }

**Nodes**: Throughout April there were around {n} reachable nodes according to [dcrextdata](https://dcrextdata.planetdecred.org/nodes).

Node versions as of {date} [snapshot](https://nodes.jholdstock.uk/user_agents) ({} total, dcrd only): { vX.Y.Z  n%, ... }

{ maybe } The share of [mixed coins](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=coin-supply&zoom={t1}-{t2}&bin=day&axis=time&visibility=true-true-true) varied between {n.n}-{n.n}%. Daily [mixed amount](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=privacy-participation&zoom={t1}-{t2}&bin=day&axis=time) varied between {n}-{n}K DCR.

{ maybe } Decred's [Lightning Network](https://ln-map.jholdstock.uk/) has seen {} nodes (+{}), {} channels (+{}) with a total capacity of {n.n} DCR (+{n.n}), as of {date}.
